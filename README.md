# Post Payment from CSV - React Application

This is a React application that allows users login, upload a CSV file, parse it, and process payments by sending the data to an API. The application provides functionality for processing individual rows or processing all rows at once. It also shows loading indicators and error messages as needed.

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)  
  You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
  
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)  
  npm is included with Node.js, so installing Node.js will also install npm.
